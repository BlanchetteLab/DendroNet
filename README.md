# DendroNet

This repository contains an implementation of the DendroNet model as described in our publication "Supervised learning on phylogenetically distributed data", published in OUP Bioinformatics and publicly available [here](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/36/Supplement_2/i895/6055926).

# Quick Start

Users looking to implement DendroNet on their own datasets are encouraged to use the example files in the dendronet_tutorials folder as a jumping off point. Requirements can be easily installed in a conda virtual environment using the instructions in requirements.txt
